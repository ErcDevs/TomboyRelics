        "desc": "Direct from the Tomboy Assay Office slag dump – an original bone-ash cupel used during the mine’s final years and especially the last assays run before permanent closure in 1928.\n\nThis is the real deal: a hand-formed magnesite/bone-ash cupel that once held a button of Tomboy ore in the assay furnace at over 1,800 °F. The molten lead from the ore completely soaked the porous cupel, turning it into a dense, glassy, lead-saturated relic that weighs a substantial 56.6 grams — far heavier than a normal spent cupel because it absorbed an extraordinary amount of lead and trace silver/gold from the rich Tomboy concentrates.\n\nYou can see the classic concave depression where the precious-metal prill sat, surrounded by the characteristic gray-white lead-glazed surface and the tell-tale cracks from rapid cooling after the furnace door was opened for the last time high above Telluride. Cupels exactly like this were used daily by the Tomboy assayers to determine the exact gold and silver values that justified keeping the mine running — this one is from the final era when the veins were playing out and every assay counted.\n\nWeight: 56.6 g documented on digital scale (included in photos)  \nDiameter: ~1.25 inches across the top  \nHeight: ~1.4 inches  \nCondition: Perfect as-recovered — stable, no repairs, loaded with century-old lead from the Tomboy veins.\n\nVery few cupels survive from any Colorado gold camp assay office, and almost none still carry this much original lead from the actual ore. This is a museum-grade piece of assay history from one of the San Juan’s most famous mines.\n\n100% authentic, hand-recovered by the current Tomboy claim holder from the official assay office slag dump at 11,600 ft.\n\nTomboy Relics – Colorado’s highest authentic mining artifacts.",

        "image": "/relicImages/gridThumbs/3main.jpeg",
        "desc": "This is not just a relic. This is THE relic.\n\nThe one and only surviving desilverizing kettle from the entire San Juan silver–gold district — and the only known Tomboy Mine kettle in existence. Every other Parkes-process kettle from Smuggler-Union, Liberty Bell, Sheridan, Revenue, or the dozens of other great San Juan smelters was cut up for scrap between 1928 and the 1950s. This is the only known sole survivor, period.\n\nUnearthed in 2025 by the current Tomboy claim holder exactly where it was abandoned in 1928 beside the smelter ruins at 11,800 ft in Savage Basin. This massive cast-iron vessel (approximately 3 ft tall × 3 ft wide, ~600–700 lbs) received the very last pour of molten lead from the Tomboy cupellation furnaces before the mine shut down forever. When zinc was stirred in, the final thousands of ounces of silver, gold, and platinum-group metals rose as a crust and bonded to the walls — creating the dozens of irregular, roughly 1-ounce “dimples” you still see frozen inside today. Those dimples are the literal fingerprints of the Tomboy’s final precious-metal recovery in 1928.\n\nThe original ¼–½ inch thick zinc–silver–gold plates that lined the kettle during its working life (the richest part of the very last pour) have been carefully removed by the claim holder and will be offered exclusively here on tomboyrelics.com (and a select few on eBay). The kettle itself still carries the irrefutable evidence of that historic final run.\n\nSpecifications  \n• Dimensions: ~36 in diameter × 36 in tall  \n• Weight: 600–700+ lbs  \n• Condition: Outstanding as-dug. Thick cast-iron walls, no cracks or repairs, century-plus smelter soot and high-alpine patina exactly as recovered.\n\nNo museum, no private collection, and no other dealer on earth can offer another. This is the single most important metallurgical artifact ever to come out of the San Juan Mountains.\n\n$336,000 – firm. Serious institutional and private inquiries only. Crating and white-glove freight worldwide available.\n\nTomboy Relics – the only place on earth you will ever see the final pour of the Tomboy Mine offered for sale.",

        "price": 95,
        "image": "/relicImages/gridThumbs/4main.jpeg",
        "desc": "Unearthed directly by the current claim holder behind the ruins of the Tomboy Mine Assayer's Office, this remarkable late-19th to early-20th century enamelware mug fragment is a genuine survivor of one of Colorado's most legendary high-altitude gold camps.\n\nCrafted from classic speckled enamel over a durable base, this mug once rode in the packs of the hard-rock miners, assayers, and camp cooks who worked the rich veins of the Tomboy Mine at over 11,500 feet above Telluride. The curved, crescent-shaped body is a broken remnant of its original form, with a clean fracture along one side revealing the full thickness of the piece—likely shattered during the chaotic abandonment of the camp in the 1920s or buried under avalanche debris in the harsh San Juan winters. The interior bears the dark patina and faint staining left by countless cups of strong coffee brewed over wood stoves in the thin mountain air, while the exterior displays a beautifully mottled mix of gray, cream, and charcoal tones—classic “stoneware” that was the workhorse of mining camps across the West.\n\nThe Tomboy Mine, discovered in 1894, quickly became one of the San Juan Mountains’ greatest producers, yielding millions in gold before closing in 1928. The assayer's office was the financial heart of the operation—every ore sample pulled from the mountain passed through its doors to be crushed, fire-assayed, and valued. This mug was recovered just feet from those foundations, unearthed during modern mining exploration on the historic claim.\n\nCondition: Excellent relic condition for its age and environment. The break is ancient and stable, with no modern repairs; all patina and surface details are authentic marks of a hard life at 11,500 feet.\n\nDimensions (approximate): 3.5 inches tall × 4 inches wide at the widest point – a substantial fragment capturing the generous size of camp mugs for keeping hands warm on sub-zero Tomboy mornings.\n\nThis is not a reproduction or souvenir—this is the real thing, hand-dug from the ground of the ghost town of Tomboy. A tangible piece of Colorado’s golden era, perfect for collectors of Western mining artifacts, San Juan history enthusiasts, or anyone who appreciates objects that still whisper stories of the men who chased fortune in the sky-high Rockies.\n\n100% authentic, directly from the Tomboy Claim above Telluride, Colorado – offered exclusively through Tomboy Relics.",

        "price": 145,
        "image": "/relicImages/gridThumbs/5main.jpeg",
        "desc": "Unearthed on the historic Tomboy Claim above Telluride, this beautifully preserved fragment of heavy wool plaid fabric is a direct survivor of the famous Tomboy mining camp (1894–1928) — one of the highest and richest gold towns in the San Juan Mountains.\n\nThis piece came from the main dump area just downhill from the boarding houses and cabins, where miners and their families discarded worn-out clothing during the camp’s peak years. The distinctive olive-green and black herringbone plaid pattern was extremely common in mackinaw coats, work shirts, and heavy winter trousers worn by hard-rock miners working at 11,500–12,000 feet elevation. Wool was the fabric of choice because it retained warmth even when soaked from sweat or snow — essential when temperatures routinely dropped to -30 °F and blizzards shut down the aerial tram for days.\n\nAfter nearly a century buried under avalanche debris and alpine soil, the wool has naturally mineralized and taken on a rich, earthy patina while retaining remarkable flexibility and detail. The tightly woven threads and frayed selvedge edges are perfectly intact, and tiny flecks of Tomboy’s iron-rich dirt still cling to the surface — exactly as it was pulled from the ground during modern claim exploration.\n\nSize: approximately 11 × 9 inches — a generous display piece.\nCondition: Excellent excavated condition; stable, no moth damage, no repairs. The irregular edges are authentic period tears and wear from use and burial.\n\nTextile relics from documented Colorado gold camps are exceedingly rare on the open market — most were burned or rotted away decades ago. This is a museum-quality piece of everyday life at one of America’s most legendary high-altitude mining towns.\n\n100% authentic, hand-recovered directly from the Tomboy townsite above Telluride. Own a literal piece of San Juan Mountain history.\n\nTomboy Relics – Colorado’s highest authentic mining artifacts.",
